### LYRICS

WE THE CHANGE
we want to see
say hi to a stranger
who stranger is no more

HUMANITY IS A TEAM SPORT
life is a game
with many moves

COMPOST THE SYSTEM
and the welfare trap
incentive to obey
and stay numb

AWAKEN FULL POTENTIAL
the task is existential
the vibe is muscle
happiness is a habit

FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT
FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT

Unapologetically bold, sorry not sorry
I'm a creator, creators don't worry
 
Everyone is the source,
Not every source can talk
Not all who talk can walk the walk
Become the beacon of new reality
Manifest new life, ultra quality

Turn it on.
The attraction.
Meaning — fluid.
Not fluid exchange.

Standard Deviation.
Not S.T.D.
Aviation.
Let it fly.

Ascend.
Transcend.
Amend.
Amen.

### Funny fact

I wrote initially "COMPOST THE SYSTEM" because I wanted to compost the system and the welfare trap but the line didn't make it to the actual dong.

AI agent was not able to listen to the song, something that I understand - you don't want AI listening to chat with the song. So I copy-pasted the lyrics it said "compost the system" is the best line... But it didn't land in the song!

It means there might be another song built around that line: "compost the system"

And the title... The song is about change. So the initial title was "We the Change" but the "Follow the White Rabbit" repeated in the middle so catchy and powerful decided to use both.
