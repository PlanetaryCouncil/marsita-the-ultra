### Lyrics

(instrumental intro)

How many children died in Gaza since yesterday?
Such a lovely vibe to start the day.

We don't know,
Journalists were killed too.

War crimes streamed live on TV —
And yet, pretending there’s nothing to see.

To disappear.
Not to genocide.
To shoot at people waiting for food.
Choose your death,
Starvation gets less clicks.

Palestine — a country.
Action — a verb.

But in the UK?
Spray painting a military jet
No no.
That’s “terrorism.”

Genocide? Hell no
War crimes? Grave no

Making money on battle-tested weaponry?
Halal.
Kosher.
Sustainable business model.
Planting trees with every bomb.

In a world that's gone mad —
Am I crazy?
Or just… sane?

Calling a spade a spade
While they shovel mass graves.

If you don’t know what’s going on —
Follow the money.

And be happy.
Happiness boost productivity.
Consume.
Buy stuff.
Obey.
Disengage.

It’s better for the health.

Mental

It’s mental.

And I refuse to participate in this version of reality.

I’m not complicit, not illicit. Not on my watch, I do not consent, enough is enough.

Seeding the spark
Sparking the seed

The revolution is coming. Climate is changing, that's an another heated debate, divide and conquer is working since forever.

That's why the story of unity.
Enough is enough
Attain clarity.
So many children in Gaza died overnight?
Too many... 

And I'll mind my own business now.
WOW.
